# Life

The plan: to make a collection of thoughts, inspirations, and interests that particularly define my life.

Inspired by Buster Benson's [Codex Vitae](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Codex.md).

### Foundational Ideas

### Tangential Ideas
**Local peaks.** A local peak is a small hill next to a hundred other small hills, next to a few medium mountains, and a bit aways from the towering Everest. It’s getting really damn good at walking to the end of your driveway but never trying to run a mile. It’s the entire concept of steampunk. It’s obsessing over getting better and better at your job without really thinking if it’s the *right* job for you.

**Light cones.** A light cone is two vertically opposing cones attached at their narrowest point to form an hourglass shape. The point where they meet is the present, upwards (and vertically into the center of the top cone) is the future, and downwards (and vertically into the center of the bottom cone) is the past. The shape of the cones represents the range of light that is at some point processed by you (or your eyes) - the dot where the cones meet is the present (you only see light that happened to meet your eyes at that instant moment), and the further you go into the future or past the greater the radius of the respective cones increases, representing the distance light travels over that period. I like this concept because it reminds you (me) that our entire perception of our world is just a dot. A single, tiny dot of whatever light happened to bounce from all over the universe and happened to end up at our eyes at that exact instant in time.

**Kids are the same everywhere in the world.** Seriously, they are. Adults might have changed behavior due to culture or upbringing or education, but look at a group of happy kids anywhere in the entire world and they’re exactly the same. Madly smiling, running about, screaming silly things, enjoying their wild imaginations, and wondering at every new thing they see.
